ldaplist is an implementation of ldaplist using python that is similar to ldaplist found on Solaris.

It reads details from /etc/ldap.conf (and similar) to connect to the datastore.

Ininitially developed for RHEL5.

I have included support for nslcd.conf and sssd.conf on RHEL6.

Seems to be working OK on Ubuntu too.

Only simple bind and anonymous authentication is currently supported.

Patches supporting other authentication mechanisms or evidince that it worked in your environment is appreciated.
